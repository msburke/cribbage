# cribbage
Cribbage game for my Code in Place final project!

If you'd like to try it out, don't forget the attached csv file! It's necessary for looking up all of the values associated with each card.
Feedback welcome!

To play:
Start by entering your name so the game can talk to you personally!

Discard and play cards by typing the number to the left of the card and pressing enter.
  (some of these aren't validated yet, so be careful with what you submit!)

Any string returned during the "pegging" portion of the game will count as "go"

Points in hands are counted automatically. Maybe self-counting is a project for another day!
